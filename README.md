# 👋 Hi, I'm Sumit Kumar  

🚀 Passionate developer exploring the intersection of **systems programming**, **game engines**, and **cutting-edge technology**.  
I love building things from scratch — whether it’s **programming languages**, **game engines**, or **custom tools** that push my understanding of low-level systems.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools  
- **Languages:** C, C++, Rust, Python, Kotlin, Java
- **Game Dev:** Unreal Engine, Unity DOTS & Netcode, SDL2 
- **Mobile Dev:** Android (Java/Kotlin, Foreground Services, Bluetooth, HID, Wi-Fi Direct)  
- **Systems Programming:** Linux internals, DRM/KMS, GATT servers, networking protocols  
- **Other Interests:** Compiler design, reverse engineering, AI integrations

## 🌟 Projects & Experiments
- 🎮 **Custom Game Engine** – OpenGL-based with an in-progress Windows Forms editor.  
- 🧙 **Wizard-themed Programming Language** – A low-level, statically-typed language with magical scripting aesthetics.  
- 📡 **Cross-Device Ecosystem** – Clipboard sync, file sharing, and communication inspired by macOS/iOS continuity.  
- ⚙️ **Low-Level Hacking** – Building/debugging LLVM-based compilers, writing HID descriptors, reverse engineering binary formats.

## 📌 Current Focus
- Improving my **game engine editor**  
- Designing **Arkana** (Wizard inspired programming language)  
- Experimenting with **Wi-Fi Direct & WebRTC** for device-to-device communication
